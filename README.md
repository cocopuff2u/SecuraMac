This method allows you to quickly fetch and execute the script in one command. Ensure you have administrative privileges (sudo access) before proceeding.

1. **Open Terminal**: 
   - You can find the Terminal application in `Applications > Utilities > Terminal` or by using Spotlight (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal," and hit Enter).

2. **Run the Command**: 
   - Copy and paste the following command into the Terminal and press Enter:
   ```bash
   sudo zsh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocopuff2u/SecuraMac/main/SecuraMac.zsh)"
   ```
   - You will be prompted to enter your password. Type your password (note that it wonâ€™t be displayed) and hit Enter.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: 
   - The script will provide guidance on what actions it is taking and any further configurations you may need to consider.

#### Method 2: Manual Download and Execution

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Go to [SecuraMac GitHub](https://github.com/cocopuff2u/SecuraMac) and download `SecuraMac.zsh`.

2. **Open Terminal**:
   - Find Terminal in `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`.

3. **Navigate to the Download Location**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```

4. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x SecuraMac.zsh
   ```

5. **Run the Script with Sudo**:
